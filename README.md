**Weather Dashboard**


For this week's challenge, I was tasked with creating a weather dashboard to showcase my understanding of API calls and responses.

This challenge has been the most interesting one so far, as it has required me to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS and a vast majority of Javascript. 

The application is operational, achieving most of the success criteria. At present, it displays the weather information for the user and presents a 5-day forecast for the desired city.

One objective that I was unable to achieve was a recent searches function. As shown in my committed files, I have typed the code but I am unsure where it has gone wrong.
